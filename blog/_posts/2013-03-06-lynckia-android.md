title: Lynckia working with Chrome beta on Android!! 
--- 

Great news everyone!

Lynckia is now officially working with the last version of Chrome Beta
on Android. That means all your applications using Lynckia are now going
mobile.

To enable WebRTC on Chrome Dev for Android:
1. Type in “chrome://flags” in the omnibox to access the flags
2. Scroll about a third down and enable the "Enable WebRTC" flag
3. You will be asked to relaunch the browser at the bottom of the page in order for the flag to take effect.

Now you can open your Lynckia application url (or our [test page]
(http://chotis2.dit.upm.es) ) and that's it :)

Keep in mind this is still a beta version and there is still a lot of
work to be done for it to work perfectly.

You can see it in action in this video:

We want to thank Google WebRTC group for their great work implementing
the standard in Chrome in every platform.
