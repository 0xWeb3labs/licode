title: New demos portal 
--- 

This week we have uploaded our demos portal with new types of applications of Licode. We have videoconference, audioconference and screen sharing demos. Furthermore, some of them are in peer-to-peer configuration. 

You can try them as always at [Licode's demos portal](http://chotis2.dit.upm.es/)

And, of course, we are going to add new demos very soon!

Best regards and enjoy Licode.
