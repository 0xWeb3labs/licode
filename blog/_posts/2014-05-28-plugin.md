title: Lynckia Screensharing extension
--- 


As you know, some days ago Chrome has updated the screensharing feature in WebRTC. Now you need to add a Chrome extension in order to share your desktop. Of course, Licode is totally compatible with the new feature and from Lynckia team we have uploaded our own extension to Google Web Store in order to support it. 

Thanks to the extension now you can select the screen or the window that you are going to share. 

You can download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lynckia-screensharing/okeephmleflklcdebijnponpabbmmgeo) and test it in our screen sharing rooms at [Licode's demo portal](http://chotis2.dit.upm.es/).

Enjoy it!
