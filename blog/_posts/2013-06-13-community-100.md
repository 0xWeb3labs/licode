We are very happy to announce that today we have processed the membership request of the 100th developer in Licode community.

Since November 2012, when we started with the community, we have more than 55 discussions with about 4 messages per day. Moreover, Licode GitHub repository has 94 stars, 27 forks, 503 commits, 8 branches and every day developers are more interested in contribute to our code.  

All these numbers are the evidence of Licode is becoming a bigger and richer project every day. Thanks to all of you, your interest, testing and hard work Licode is a reference in the Open Source WebRTC communications providers.

Thank you very much.
