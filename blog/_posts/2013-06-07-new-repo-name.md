title: New GitHub repository name
--- 

Regarding the new name of our project [Licode](http://lynckia.com/licode/LicodeNow.html) today we have made the last change. It consists of update the name of our github repository. The new path is [Licode GitHub](https://github.com/ging/licode).

GitHub [redirects automatically](https://github.com/blog/1508-repository-redirects-are-here) your project to the new one. So if you have already cloned it you only need to make a pull in order to update the changes (we have made some changes in scripts names and so on). 

In advance you should clone the repository from the new path. We have updated the instructions in [installing Licode](http://lynckia.com/licode/install.html). 

Thank you very much and enjoy Licode.
Best regards
