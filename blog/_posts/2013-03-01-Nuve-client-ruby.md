title: Nuve Client now available in ruby
--- 

Today we announce that now you can access to nuve API from your ruby server applications. Thanks to the nuve library developed in ruby now Lynckia is able to run with the three most popular server side languages: node.js, python and ruby.

You can find the library in our github repository (https://github.com/ging/lynckia/tree/master/nuve/nuveClient_ruby) and use it following the same API that in the rest of languages (http://lynckia.com/server-api.html). You can feedback your impressions or problems in our mail list. Enjoy it!
