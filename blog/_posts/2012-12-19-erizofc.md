title: Connecting erizo clients to Lynckia in your node.js applications.  
--- 

Some weaks ago we had a very cool idea. We were talking about the posibility of running an erizo client in a node.js application and connect it to a Lynckia session. With this feature you can include in your Lynckia rooms streams from a client that not necessarily runs in a browser. It may be of interest for example for doing some operations with the streams like processing or synchronization.

Today it is posible with <code>erizofc</code>, a node module that you can include in your node application to run erizo clients with the same API used in browsers. You can check the API [here](http://lynckia.com/client-api.html). <code>erizofc</code> is simply a new compilation of the erizoClient source code changing the socket.io library and considering some particular characteristics that differentiates browser and node applications. To connect with socket.io a node.js application working like a client to another working like a server we use the node module [*socket.io-client*](http://npmjs.org/package/socket.io-client).

By the moment it is only possible to publish and subscribe data streams from the node.js clients. However we are working in the feature of manage different ways of obtain media streams using streams from URLs rtp, rtsp, rtmp ...
