title: Lynckia project now is Licode
--- 

Today we announce that our Open Source project Lynckia now is called Licode. But donâ€™t worry! Nothing is different in Licode. We are working hard on new features and with your help, and all the community Licode is becoming more and more amazing every day.

You can find some information about our development group at [Lynckia](http://lynckia.com) and all the resources and documentation of Licode at [Licode](http://lynckia.com/licode).

Thank you very much.  And enjoy Licode.
