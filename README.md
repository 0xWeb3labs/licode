# Erizo, a C/C++ Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Library for WebRTC 

Erizo is a project that aims to implement a library able to communicate with WebRTC browser clients in order to provide advanced communication services. Currently it is tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and above but it should be able to be compiled on other distributions.

## Directory structure

/src -  The root source directory.
/src/erizo - The source of the main library
/src/examples - Examples and tests

## Requirements

- libSRTP version >= 1.4.4
- Libnice version >= 1.10
- boost_threads >= 1.49
- boost_regex >= 1.49 (optional, only for examples)

- CMake >= 2.8 for building

## Building Instructions

This project is built using CMake. It is better to build it out of source.
Run the usual: cmake {location of /src}. It generates two main targets: erizo and examples.
Making erizo generates liberizo.so which is required to compile the examples.
