              <h3>Rooms</h3>
              <p>All users and clients in a room can share their streams through Lynckia.</p>
              <p>They can act like videoconferencing chats, instant messaging rooms, video streaming sessions, and any other kind of virtual space for real-time collaboration.</p>
              <p>A room is created by server apps through Nuve API, and the users will connect to these rooms through Erizo.</p>
              <p>Rooms are controlled by Erizo Controller, which manages Erizo through a JavaScript wrapper called Erizo API to control streams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="server">
              <h3>Server</h3>
              <p>Developers will manage rooms (creation and deletion) from their server apps.</p>
              <p>Typical server apps can create a room, and request access for their users to Nuve, via a token-based authentication mechanism.</p>
              <p>This mechanism allows these servers to create access tokens, and they will provide these tokens to their clients.</p>
              <p>Server talks to Nuve in order to do these actions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="erizo">
              <h3>Erizo</h3>
              <p>Clients will connect users to rooms through Erizo service. Developers can manage this service with a JavaScript library that runs in the browser.</p>
              <p>Erizo is a cloud-based scalable service that allows multiple users to connect to Lynckia rooms. These rooms are created by the server apps using Nuve API.</p>
              <p>Erizo Controllerwhich manages Erizo through a JavaScript wrapper called Erizo API to control streams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="nuve">
              <h3>Nuve API</h3>
              <p>Developers can manage Lynckia rooms by sending requests to this API. These requests are typically sent from server apps, coded in python, node.js, Ruby on Rails, and so on. </p>
              <p>Lynckia provides different libraries, plug-ins and add-ons to facilitate the tasks of creating and removing rooms.</p>
              <p>Server apps can also ask for access tokens to this API. These tokens are needed for user connections, so developers should pass them to clients.</p>
              <p>Server talks to Nuve in order to do these actions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="clients">
              <h3>Clients</h3>
              <p>Clients are JavaScript applications that run on browsers. Users will be able to access Lynckia rooms by using these clients.</p>
              <p>When connecting to a room a client needs the access token that is usually taken by server apps.</p>
              <p>But the use of these rooms depends on your imagination! You could implement videoconference rooms, chat, synchronization mechanisms, VoIP applications, and so on.</p>
              <p>Clients talk to Erizo Controller through Erizo client, which is part of this project.</p>
